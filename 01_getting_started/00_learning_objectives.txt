Learning outcomes
Welcome to C Programming: Getting Started! In this course, you will learn the principles of 
C programming and start coding hands-on in a browser tool that will provide instant feedback 
on your code.

In this course, you will get started with C and learn how to write your first programs, how 
to make simple computations and print the results to the screen, how to store values in 
variables and how to repeat instructions using loops. 

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Define, distinguish and give examples of hardware/software, computer programs/algorithms
* Explain the concept of a variable and declare, initialize and modify variables of data 
types int, double and character
* Create and comment simple C-programs that may print text, special characters and variables 
to the screen with controlled formatting
* Create simple C-programs that utilize for-loops to repeat blocks of instructions
