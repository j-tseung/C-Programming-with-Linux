Learning outcomes
In this course, third course of the C Programming with Linux Professional Certificate program,  you will be introduced to the concept of modular programming: that is, dividing up more complex tasks into manageable pieces.

You will learn how to write your own functions (just like functions in mathematics for example). You will also gain insight into a computer's architecture and learn how its memory is organized.

Given the vast amount of memory computers have these days, how does your program remember where a certain variable is stored? This brings about the important topic of how memory is efficiently addressed inside a computer, and with it, the topic of pointers. 

Pointers are often considered the most difficult part and main struggle for C program developers. We will introduce you to this central topic with our novel and innovative visualization tools and show you precisely how pointers work. No need to struggle!

At the end of this course, you will be able to:

Break a complex programming task into a number of functions to which you pass arguments
Recall how computer memory is organized to store variables and arrays
Find the address of a variable 
Perform simple pointer arithmetic
